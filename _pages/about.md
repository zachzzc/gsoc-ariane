Hi! My name is Zach. I just finished my batchelor degree at the University of Toronto. Starting from September this year I will be at the University of California Berkeley to pursue my master degree in EECS Meng program. I have a strong interest in computer architecture and hardware acceleration. In the previous years, I did internships in Intel and Amazon but it is my first time to join an open-source project. I really look forward to having such great experience this summer.
